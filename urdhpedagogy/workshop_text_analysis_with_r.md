## Code and Text Analysis in the Classroom

I know that you have been working with a lot of DH tools this semester and
thinking about how to integrate them into your courses. Today I am going to
talk about how you might use a programming language, instead of a point and
click tool, to work with your data. I will talk a bit about code and my
approach in the classroom and then we'll jump into an example using R for
text analysis.

### R and Python

In my research I write a lot of code that looks exactly like what you might
expect. Thousands of lines of highlighted code, which I navigate using fast
keyboard shortcuts. However, coding in the classroom can look a lot different
from this with new languages such as R and Python and interfaces such as
Jupyter and RStudio notebooks. We will see some examples of these today. The
basic idea is that there are blocks of code interwoven with text. Running the
code produces immediate output. Students, depending on the class, can be asked
to make minor (or major) changes to the code to affect the output.

### Examples

Here is what the final project for my Introduction to Data Science course
looks like (they are still finishing the introductory page, but here is an
example of the interactive website one student built):

[MATH289 Project](https://colbyprokop.github.io/stat289/docs.html)

She had no prior programming experience before taking this course.

This summer, Lauren and I gave a three-hour workshop on image analysis with
Python. Here are some of the examples of the code that we walked through:

- [Part 1: Introduction and initial features](https://www.distantviewing.org/tutorial/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-1.html)
- [Part 2: Deep learning for image processing](https://www.distantviewing.org/tutorial/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-2.html)
- [Part 4: Face detection and recognition](https://www.distantviewing.org/tutorial/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-4.html)

And here is an online tutorial that Lauren and I wrote about text analysis in R
(today's note are actually an extension of this tutorial):

[Basic Text Processing in R ](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/basic-text-processing-in-r)

There are lots of examples online of tutorials, notes, and other resources for
using R and Python for data analysis.

### Pros and cons (my thoughts)

Writing code instead of using one-off tools comes with some benefits and tradeoffs.
My general advice is that the more digital/computational methods you want to use,
the more it makes sense to use a programming language. The type of data you work
with is also important. Spatial data, in my opinion, offers the smallest benefit
to programming. Text and image data offer the largest.

Benefits of using a programming language:
- Only need to install one tool for multiple applications.
- More control (almost unlimited) on what is possible.
- Students learn a useful skill (ArcGIS is the one tool exception)
- Demystifies the process of coding. Yes, you can really can do it!
- Easier to extend for other projects beyond the classroom.
- Much easier to provide resources and notes.
- Programming languages are much better maintained and consistent.
- Opens up "code" as an object of study (see, Critical Data/Code Studies).

Drawbacks of using a programming language:
- Increased learning curve, particularly if you want students to use their own data.
- Can be more difficult to install (though some tools are bad to install as well).
- Creating materials requires that instructor knows the language well or has a lot of assistance.

I'm sure there are more, particularly in the second set, that I have not thought of
and would be happy to talk more now or later about the right choice for your application.
