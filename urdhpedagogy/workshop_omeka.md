# Introduction and Sign Up

Omeka is a service created out of [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/) for creating databases, and it has become a defacto tool for many digital humanities projects.  Omeka is simple, but at the same time, this limits its flexibility.  Currently, at the University of Richmond, we have support for smaller projects, such as those used for classrooms but not for larger ones. In this tutorial, we are going to use [Omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net).  Let's go ahead and [sign up for an account](https://www.omeka.net/signup) -- please check your spam folder just in case.

# Dashboard 
 
When you login, you should see the ability to add a website. Title your site whatever you want. 

You will see the *dashboard*, which is the main launching page for your website.  On the side, you will see five items:

1. Dashboard-Takes us to the main launching page.
2. Items-As the name implies, items are the main "units" of our Omeka archive. 
3. Collections-Collections are groups of items that are placed together with some sort of commonality between them. 
4. Item Types-Item types allow us to adjust the metadata for our items.  We can also add our own metadata.
5. Tags-Tags, like collections, allow us to group certain items together.  They also provide metadata for items that may make it easier for others to navigate to the items they want in our website. 

Let's go ahead and download a few images.  We are mainly going to use images, as they are probably the most common data type placed on Omeka websites.  

Try to find some images on the Smithsonian website or some other museum website so that you also have some metadata information.  Omeka follows the [Dublin Core standard.](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core/)  The problem with the Dublin Standard is that, at least in the way Omeka supports it, you are required to fill in all the data.  You can add additional fields, but you cannot remove fields.  

1. Click on *Items* and then "Add Item."  
2. Go ahead and fill out the information for your item.  
3. At the top of the page, there will be a tab called "Files" where you can upload the image itself.  
4. On the right hand side, there will be a check box labeled "Public."  This allows our item to be available immediately.  The reason why you may not want to do this is if you want to allow students a way to edit their items before you actually make them visible on the site.

Now let's go ahead and add a *Collection*.  

1. Click on "Collections" on the left side and click "Add a Collection." 
2.  On this page, you can group items together.  Fill in the relevant Dublin Core fields, and click the "Public" checkbox.

This will create our collection, but we still need to actually add our items to the collection.  
1. Go back to the Item page and "Edit" one of your items.  
2. On the right side, there will be a dropdown menu under the word "Collection."  Choose the collection you just created.  When we view our website now, we should now see our new collection.

With this basic foundation, we can create fairly powerful websites.  Depending on the Omeka.net package you sign up for, you can also install various plugins and themes.  If you install your own version of [Omeka Classic](https://omeka.org/classic/), then you can also install as many themes and plugins that you would like.  Some of the most popular ones are [Exhibit Builder]( https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/), which allow us to create small narratives with our items, [Simple Pages](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/SimplePages/) which creates static pages where we can insert in information about our project, and [Neatline](http://neatline.org), which provides the ability to create an interactive timeline of our items.  

The makers of Omeka have also created a new version of their software called [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/).  At the time of this writing, this version is still in beta.  For the purposes of this tutorial, however, it is worth noting that Omeka S plugins DO NOT work with Omeka Classic.  Consequently, if you are interested in exploring additional plugins, please make sure they have backwards compatibility with Omeka Classic. 

This tutorial should have provided you a foundation for future work. If you ever get stuck, Omeka has an excellent [User Manual](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/) that should be able to answer most questions.
