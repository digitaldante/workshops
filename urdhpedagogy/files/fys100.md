# FYS 100: Final Assignment


## Overview 
As Stuart Hall argues, media functions within, produces, and circulates ideologies.  
In other words, media is where ideologies “are articulated, worked on, transformed and elaborated” (Hall, 20).  
The goal of this digital StoryMap is to focus on one component of an underground press and articulate the ideology/ 
ideologies that piece of media is articulating, working on, transforming and circulating. 
This could be a cover, photo, comic, specific article, etc. It should be chosen from an underground press publication
from the Popular Culture in Britain and America, 1950-1975 archive  by searching the database by "Underground Press".

For example, the classifieds section of the underground press offers a lens into how gender and sexuality were 
being negotiated. What ideologies about sexuality is the underground press articulating, shifting, and
transforming ideas during the era? The answer to this question would be the thesis statement.

The project must:
- Make an argument about an ideology/ ideologies of the publication
- Contextualizes the publication within the 1960s 
- Connect to a major theme of the class 
- Include a ThingLink that close reads at least one piece of media 

As well: 
- Word Count: 1000 words
- Images: Must at least include your underground press image
- Citation: Adapted Chicago Footnotes style (discussed during workshop)
