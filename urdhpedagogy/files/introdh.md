Digital Humanities or “DH” brings the application of computing to humanities questions. 
In this course, we explore applying computational methods including text analysis, mapping, and network analysis 
to humanities data. Our guiding questions include:
- What is humanities data?
- Why apply computational methods to the humanities and how?
- Which methods are best for which forms of inquiry?
- What new forms of scholarly inquiry are made possible?
- What are the challenges and limitations of DH?
