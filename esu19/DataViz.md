## Data Visualization


### Goals

- An introduction to data visualization techniques. 
- Explore how tidy data can be visualized. 
- See why the time invested in creating tidy data may be worth it!



### Our Data

In groups, compare the the data that we created to the Normalized Aggregate spreadsheet in the [movie data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QFSYByVEQLY14oQChi4LCvzlTotCjvikdoLdcDWeNg/edit?usp=sharing). 
- What are the similarities?  Pick 2 and be prepared to explain to the group. 
- What are the differences? Pick 2 and be prepared to explain to the group. 


### Our Tool: Flourish

Flourish is a visualization and storytelling platform. It is a freemium product. The free account means that all data is public. 

Set-up an account [here](https://flourish.studio/).

We recognize that a personal account is expensive. The goal of this workshop is not to focus on the tool but of exploratory data viz. 

It is partially modeled on the Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics, which is foundational to exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the field of Statistics; this is also the basis for the very popular R visualization ggplot. The idea is that you take a geometry (ex. points, lines, maps, etc) and then you map the variable into the aesthetics. For example, we can select a scatter plot (geometry) and map the movie data (variables) and select how we want the visualize to look (aesthetics).  


### Exploratory Data Analysis


Using our data set, let's explore some of the visualizations in the tool!

- Budget and Run Time
- Country by Genre
- Mapping

Now explore in groups of 2. In 20 minutes, be prepared to share what you have discovered!
