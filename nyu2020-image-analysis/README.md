## Description

How can we use digital methods to analyze images such as films, manuscripts, paintings, and photographs? 
This workshop will explore how computers view images and methods for analysis including color, 
image similarity, and feature detection such as faces and objects. 
The workshop will use out-of-the-box toolkits and programming in R; 
it is designed for participants with no programming experience.

## Goals
- Possibilites for humanistic inquiry with image analysis 
- Developing familiarity with programming languages and EDA
- How to structure data for image analysis
- Understand how computers "process" images
- Begin building a methodological toolkit (i.e. feature extraction) for image analysis
- Introduce the concept of Distant Viewing
