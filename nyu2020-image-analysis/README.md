## Description

How can we use digital methods to analyze images such as films, manuscripts, paintings, and photographs? 
This workshop will explore how computers view images and methods for analysis including color, 
image similarity, and feature detection such as faces and objects. 
The workshop will use out-of-the-box toolkits and programming in R; 
it is designed for participants with no programming experience.

## Goals



## Schedule â€” Overview

Our specific pace and topics will adjust given the needs of those in the workshop,
but here is an overview of what we plan to cover each day:


| Day        |  Time           | #  | Topics  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|
| Sunday, Jan 19     | 	1400-1630 | 1|  introductions, community guidelines, setting up R, setting up an image corpora |
| Monday, Jan 20     | 	1000-1230      |   2| what's possible?; what is an image?; what is a digital image? |
| Monday, Jan 20 | 	1400-1600   |    3 | distant viewing; code systems - annotating color (hsv, brightness), complexity |
| Tuesday, Jan 21 | 	1000-1230  |    4 | code systems - annotating features (facial recognition; objects); transfer learning; aggregating - image similarity|
| Tuesday, Jan 21 | 	1400-1600  |   5 | exploring - summary stats |
| Wednesday, Jan 22 | 	1400-1600  |   6 | communicating - recommender systems, tensorflow.js and pixplot|


## Community Expectations
We will create our expectations together.

## Code of Conduct

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as
soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you
make our event a better place.

In order for this tutorial to be successful, we ask that participants take note
of the following guidelines throughout the session:

- This is an interactive workshop, and we expect everyone to, as best as possible,
follow along with the tutorial.
- At the same time, please stay at the same point with us in the tutorial. If you are
finished with a section ahead of time, you are more than welcome to hack away at our
code. We find that staying together through the tutorial works best for everyone
involved.
- Please only drive your computer. You are more than welcome to explain to your neighbors
what is going on in their notebook, but we want everyone to feel comfortable working
with the code themselves.



## Software

We will be using the R and Python programming language for the workshop, as well as
several third-party packages. All of it is free and open source. Here is the
link to the Anaconda version of Python that we suggest you use:

- [Anaconda Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/)

We will help you set-up these libraries in the workshop, though please make sure
your operating system is up-to-date (in particular, you will need macOS 10.13 or
10.14 for the libraries to work properly). If you have a previous version of
Anaconda, we generally suggest that you start from scratch.
